With this two commands we will enable to run the server also all the schemas on mysql database will be run.

Question: Argument your database choice in the Readme.md file - why relational/noSQL, why a postgres/mysql etc.

I have chosen SQL technologie because SQL databases are efficient at processing queries and joining data across tables, making it easier to perform complex queries against structured data, including ad hoc requests.SQL databases are built on mature technologies that are well known and supported by large developer communities.

As for the NoSQL databases they lack consistency across products and typically require more work to query data, particular as query complexity increases.NoSQL products are not as mature and the technologies not as well supported as SQL products, but NoSQL technologies are making fast inroads into the industry, with developer communities constantly growing.
